# Mercearia Do Bairro
My very first back-end project. This was a challange knowing I had never wroked with PHP or Databases before I needed to create an e-commerce with all functionalities.

For this project I used PHP (with procedimental programming), MySQL and Bootstrap (HTML5 and CSS3). The back-end implementation tooked me a month, and the front-end implementation tooked me a few hours.
